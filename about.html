			<h3>What is a PWA?</h3>
			<p>To put it simply, a PWA is just like a website but has some special extra features which allow it to work better. You can read more about them <a href="https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/">here</a>.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>How do I install this site as a PWA?</h3>
			<p>It's actually very simple, though depends on your device and browser. Click <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2020/05/24/how-install-progressive-web-app-pwa-android-ios-pc-mac/">here</a> for some instructions on how to install a PWA. If you're on Android you can also install from the Play Store (currently in review).</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Why did you build this?</h3>
			<p>I noticed that Amtrak's official tracking tool was way too data heavy to be used on any route with only 3G or even 2G. This led me down a path of making my own <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/amtrak">Amtrak Library for Node.js</a> and then <a href="https://amtrak.piemadd.com/">an api to go with it</a>. I expected these to enable other develop tools similar to this, but I never saw any pop up. I then decided to take it upon myself to develop this site ad app, which is why you're here.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Can I see the source code and contribute?</h3>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/pieromqwerty/Piero-Amtrak-Train-Tracker">You sure can!</a></p>
			<br>
			<h3>Is there any way I can donate to the project?</h3>
			<p>Right now, no. I do plan on looking into adding advertisements or a small fee (99 cents a month) to remove ads. I just have to ensure that the loading of ads doesn't interfere with the loading of any tracking data.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>I have a reccomendation for the project. Where do I direct my concerns?</h3>
			<p>Sure thing! You can either <a href="https://github.com/pieromqwerty/Piero-Amtrak-Train-Tracker/issues/new">make an issue on github</a>, submit feedback/issues to the <a href="https://forms.gle/MyUjkXgJKwDW1rnu5">contact form</a>, <a href="mailto:amtrak@piemadd.com">send me an email</a>, message me on Discord (piero#0001), or follow and DM me on my various social medias (@piemadd most places).</p>
			<br>
			<h3>I'm a big fan of your work. Can we meetup or something?</h3>
			<p>If you're ever hopping on through Chicago and would like to sit down for a coffee/lunch to talk about Amtrak or programming, feel free to contact me (details above) and we can figure something out!</p>

			<br>
			<h3>Some data I'm seeing is incorrect.</h3>
			<p>Oh noes! Please take a/some screenshot(s) of what you're seeing (make sure the train number and day are recorded) and <a href="https://github.com/pieromqwerty/Piero-Amtrak-Train-Tracker/issues/new">submit an issue on github</a>. I'll get to fixing it as soon as I can. If you're not on github, you can also submit feedback/issues to the <a href="https://forms.gle/MyUjkXgJKwDW1rnu5">contact form</a>.</p>
